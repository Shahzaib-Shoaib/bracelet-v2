      longDescription="Clear Quartz is known as the 'master healer' and the 'stone of power.' This versatile crystal amplifies energy and thought, as well as the effect of other crystals. It absorbs, stores, releases, and regulates energy, making it an essential crystal for any collection.\n\nClear Quartz has been used by ancient civilizations around the world for its healing properties and ability to connect with higher realms. The ancient Greeks believed it was a form of permanent ice, hence the name 'krystallos' meaning 'ice'.\n\nThis transparent crystal works with all chakras to bring balance and harmony. It's particularly effective for activating the crown chakra, which connects us to higher consciousness and spiritual wisdom. Clear Quartz is also known for its ability to program with intention, making it a powerful tool for manifestation."
