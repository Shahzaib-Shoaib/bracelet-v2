      longDescription="Black Tourmaline, also known as Schorl, is one of the most powerful protective stones available. It creates a protective shield around your energy field, deflecting and absorbing negative energies, psychic attacks, and environmental pollutants.\n\nThis opaque, black crystal has been used as a protective talisman since ancient times. It was believed to protect the wearer from evil spirits, negative thoughts, and harmful intentions. In modern times, it's valued for its ability to protect against electromagnetic radiation from computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices.\n\nBlack Tourmaline is a grounding stone that works primarily with the root chakra, promoting a sense of safety and security. It helps to anchor spiritual energy into the physical body, making it an excellent stone for spiritual grounding during meditation or energy work."
